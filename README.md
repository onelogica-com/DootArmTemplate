Arm template
ARM (Azure Resource Manager) templates are JSON-based files used to define and deploy resources in Microsoft Azure. They allow you to automate the creation, configuration, and deployment of Azure services by defining resources, dependencies, and configurations in a single, declarative template.

To meet these challenges, you can automate deployments and use the practice of infrastructure as code. In code, you define the infrastructure that needs to be deployed. The infrastructure code becomes part of your project. Just like application code, you store the infrastructure code in a source repository and version it. Anyone on your team can run the code and deploy similar environments.

Features
Declarative Syntax: Define infrastructure without scripting deployment order.

Idempotency: Ensures consistent results on repeated deployments.

Modularity: Supports linked templates for reusability and maintainability.

Automation: Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for continuous deployment.

Extensive Azure Resource Support: Deploys and configures most Azure services.
